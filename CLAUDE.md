  - `GET /weights/:id` - Get single weight with full photo details
  - `DELETE /weights/:id` - Delete weight and associated photos
  - `GET /dashboard` - Unified dashboard data endpoint
  - `GET /weights/paginated` - Paginated weight list (hasPhoto boolean only)
  - `GET /weights/chart-data` - Chart data with time range filtering

### UI Architecture
- **Dashboard Layout**: Split view with left sidebar (35%) and right content panel (65%)
- **Authentication Flow**: Login/Register with real-time validation
- **Modular Components**: Reusable UI components in dedicated directories
- **Color Scheme**: Green-based color palette (updated from blue)

## Development Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User credentials are validated in real-time
2. JWT tokens are stored securely in keychain
3. API requests automatically include Bearer authentication
4. Token expiration triggers automatic logout

### Dashboard Data Flow
1. DashboardService fetches aggregated data from `/dashboard` endpoint
2. DashboardViewModel manages state and user interactions
3. UI components reactively update based on ViewModel state

### Weight Data Architecture
- **Unified API Approach**: Single endpoints for weight management with automatic photo handling
- **Smart Photo Loading**: Paginated endpoint returns hasPhoto boolean, individual endpoint provides full photo details
- **Paginated Data** (`weights[]`): 5 records per page for table display with smart navigation, sorted by most recent first
- **Chart Data**: Separate optimized endpoint for visualization with time range filtering, defaults to 'all' records
- **Auto-Navigation**: Smart pagination that navigates to previous page when current page becomes empty after deletion
- **Photo Integration**: Photos are automatically handled through weight endpoints (no separate photo CRUD)
- **Time Range Options**: Chart supports "Todos" (all), "1 mes", "3 meses", "6 meses", "1 aÃ±o" - removed "1 semana" option

### Error Handling Strategy
- API errors are localized to Spanish
- Network errors include retry logic
- Authentication failures trigger automatic token cleanup
- User-friendly error messages displayed in UI

### Photo Management
- **Unified Upload**: Photos uploaded via multipart form data with weight creation/update
- **Automatic Compression**: Images compressed to 80% quality with 1024px max dimension
- **Smart Preview**: Edit modal automatically fetches photo details when needed
- **Single Action**: "Cambiar foto" button replaces image (no separate delete needed)

### Logging Strategy
- **Minimal Logging**: Only essential user information logged on dashboard load
- **User Info Log**: `ðŸ‘¤ [DASHBOARD] User: {username} ({email}) - ID: {id}` on login
- **Clean Console**: All debug logs removed for production readiness

### Progress Modal Implementation
